### Original description

OdtPHP is a library to quickly generate Open Document Text-files that can be read by a [gigantic set][3] of Office Suites, including LibreOffice, OpenOffice and even Microsoft Office from PHP code. It uses a simple templating mechanism.
See the tests/ folder for a set of examples.

This repository already includes the changes suggested by [Vikas Mahajan][1] and a number of other bug fixes.

### History

This project was initially started by Julien Pauli, Olivier Booklage, Vincent Brout√© and published at [http://www.odtphp.com][2] (link leads to archived version of page, as it is not available any longer).
